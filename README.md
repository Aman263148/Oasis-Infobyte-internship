# Oasis-Infobyte-internship
Hello Everyone 
I am doing My internship with OASIS INFOBYTE.This internship is very helpful in my career. In this internship I work on some real life projects. These projects are most comman in Data Science.
The Projects are
1- IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 
    This model is mainly based on the IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION. In this project IRIS FLOWER has three species: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica, which differ  according to their measurements.
    Now We have to train a machine learning model who predicts the type of Species by  the measurement of IRIS FLOWER.
    The measurement is like SepalLengthCm,SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm. 
    In this project I have trained three different Machine learning models for prediction they are such as LogisticRegression Model, KNeighborsClassifier Model and DecisionTreeClassifier Model,
    and these models takes measurement of iris flower as input and predicts type of Species in result, The accuracy score of these models are 97.77, 95.55 and 95.55 .
    This IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION project is very helpful for Understanding different Machine Learning Models.

2- UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
   In this project I have an Analysis UNEMPLOYMENT WITH PYTHON. In this project I have analyzed the Data which contains many things like Region, Estimated Unemployment Rate (%), Estimated Employed,
   Estimated Labour participation Rate (%), and Area. Based on the given date I have created some interactive visualisations which help us to understand the given Data.
   This Analysis project is very helpful to every data analyst in their data science journey. 
   I am very thankful to Oasis Infobyte for giving me this type of real project. This type of project enhanced my Analytical skills.

3- CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING 
   This is a Car Price Prediction Machine learning project.
   In this project I have trained in a machine learning model which predicts the price of a Car. And the Car price depends on the various factors like the features of  Car, Mileage etc. 
   Car price prediction is a common project in the Data SCIENCE field.
   In this project I have trained a Linear Regression Machine Learning Model for Car price prediction.
   Linear Regression Model is a most common Machine Learning model.
